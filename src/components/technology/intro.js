          Barnabus isn’t a system you install, it’s a living intelligence fabric
          that grows, adapts, and reasons across any environment. <br />
          <br />
          Built on a modular architecture of collaborating agents, Barnabus
          doesn’t just follow logic — it learns, understands, and evolves. At
          its heart, Barnabus unites reasoning, memory, and governance into a
          continuously adaptive ecosystem.
