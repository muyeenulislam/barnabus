          Barnabus is more than a platform, itâ€™s a living ecosystem of
          intelligent agents designed to think, act, and adapt across any

          Unlike conventional AI tools that serve a fixed purpose, Barnabus is
          configurable, composable, and domain-aware. It can be deployed,
          customized, and evolved to meet unique industry requirements, from
          hospitals and fabs to enterprises and public institutions.
